abstract: >-
  An open-source adaptive psychometric system for mapping the ethical profile
  of AI agents. MSE uses penalized logistic threshold estimation (RLTM) and
  Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) to measure moral reasoning patterns
  across 15 axes of ethical tension using 270 calibrated dilemmas.
